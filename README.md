"Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" from Kaggle
My first kaggle project. I'm comparing different Tools like RandomForrest, LogisticRegression etc.
Currently at ca 76.5%acc

I tied many different versions and started to focus on RandomForrest. The Treeclassifiers seem to perform the best in this task. It's interresting that I get better results if I use fewer columns.

this is the Kaggle-Score i got from titanicforrest

For anyone reading this. Sorry for the spelling mistakes that might be there. It wasn't a priority to me as this is just a project for me to learn ml Tools.
