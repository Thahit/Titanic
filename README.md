"Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" from Kaggle
My first kaggle project. I'm comparing different Tools like RandomForrest, LogisticRegression etc.
at ca 76.5%acc with the TitanicTry notebook.

I tied many different versions and started to focus on RandomForrest. The Treeclassifiers seem to perform the best in this task. It's interresting that I get better results if I use fewer columns. I removed a lot of plotting and other stuff, i tried to only focus on performance on that one. If you want to see more information, look at the "try" notebook.
A lot of the testing was done on kaggle, without uploading it here all the time, so the steps don't seem as obvious here.

this is the Kaggle-Score i got from titanicforrest:

I looked at a lot of notebooks from other people to see, what worked best for them.

For anyone reading this. Sorry for the spelling mistakes that might be there. It wasn't a priority to me as this is just a project for me to learn ml Tools.
